# Rosenblatt Shop Shop
## by Aaron Rosenblatt

### I refactored the code for an e-commerce platform so that it uses Redux instead of React's Context API. Specifically, the platform uses Redux to manage the global state instead of the Context API. I changed the appâ€™s store so that it uses a Redux store instead of the Context API. I also changed the way the React front end accesses the store so it uses a Redux provider. Changes were made to the global state so the app passes reducers to a Redux store instead of using the Context API. Finally, I made changes so the app uses Redux instead of Context API when the app extracts data from the store and dispatches actions.
